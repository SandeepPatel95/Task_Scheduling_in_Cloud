#Task Scheduling in Cloud Environments Using Metaheuristic Algorithms:
Overview
This repository explores task scheduling strategies in cloud computing environments using various metaheuristic algorithms. Efficient task scheduling is crucial for optimizing resource utilization, reducing response time, and maintaining high performance. This project implements and compares popular metaheuristic algorithms to find near-optimal scheduling solutions for complex, NP-hard problems.
#Harmony Search (HS):
Description: HS is a metaheuristic algorithm inspired by musical improvisation, refining solutions to find near-optimal results.

Key Steps:

1.Initialize Harmony Memory (HM) with random solutions.
2.Improvise a New Harmony:
  Select values from HM (with HMCR probability).
  Adjust values (with PAR).
  Add random new values if needed.
3.Evaluate and Update: Replace the weakest in HM if the new solution is better.
4.Repeat until a termination condition (e.g., max iterations) is met.
Advantages:
Simple and flexible with minimal parameters.
Effective for global search across diverse problem spaces.
Use Case: Optimizing task scheduling in cloud environments to balance resource use and minimize makespan.

Parameters:
HMS: Number of solutions.
HMCR: Probability of selecting from HM.
PAR: Probability of adjustments.
bw: Adjustment range.
